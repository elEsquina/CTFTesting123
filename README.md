Hello you will find here a DFIR CTF challenges each one with its file

name: Cipher-C
Description: The company has been compromised. We've identified an internal operative, known only as 'C', who attempted to leak sensitive data. Agent C was forced to abandon their mission, but we intercepted a fragmented data dump from their operational tracker.

What I want you todo is try to solve the challenge when you are done, create a MD's file containing the solution detailed and the flags at the end. Goodluck
